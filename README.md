_Horror game about cards and balance theme._

## âœ¨ About

Upon waking up at the table, you see Something in front of you. You donâ€™t know who you are or where you are. This Something addresses you as Prisoner #666 and offers you a game.

The rules are simple: youâ€™ll play blackjack until one of you runs out of money - or nerve. Once you lose everything or decide to quit, youâ€™ll have to buy a pack of ammunition (I recommend blanks).

As soon as you do, the final round begins under the same rules. After this last purchase, youâ€™ll have to play Russian Roulette with the bullets you were lucky enough to buy.

Good luckâ€¦


Designed as a small project for [Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2025/).

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Play blackjack.
- **If you win all balance** you can buy blank bullets for russian roulette.
- **If you lose all you balance** you can buy only live bullets for russian roulette.
- After two blackjack rounds (a new round starts after purchasing bullets) you will need to load your revolver and enjoy the Russian roulette.
